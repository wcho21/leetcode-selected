Problem: [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted][problem]

[problem]: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/



## How to solve

Solve with two pointer technique.
Beginning with numbers at the two ends, move a pointer if the sum is not equal to the given target.



## Complexities

Suppose that the input array has a length of $N$.

### Time

Two pointer iterates over at most $O(N)$ numbers.
Thus, $O(N)$ time required.

### Space

$O(1)$ extra space required.
